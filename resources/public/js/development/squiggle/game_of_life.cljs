; Rules to Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
;
; The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of
; square "cells", each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead,
; (or "populated" and "unpopulated" respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight
; neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
; At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
;
; 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
; 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
; 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
; 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
;
; The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by
; applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur
; simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick
; (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue
; to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
