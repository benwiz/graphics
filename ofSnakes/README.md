#  snakes

## What

Draw a grid of miniature "snakes" (like the game). It actually looks pretty nice.

## How

OpenFrameworks, C++

## To Do

- More complex paths (probably allow overlapping)

## Other similar project ideas

- Some sort of path generation (random search/walk with dead ends?) then have the dots move all over the path bouncing off each other or merging into bigger dots
