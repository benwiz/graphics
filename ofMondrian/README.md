#  Mondrian

## What

Randomly generate a Mondrian-like image.

## How

OpenFrameworks, C++

## To Do

- Placement of background rectangle can be improved

### To Do Never

- Ensure lines are not too close to each other and merge into a single fat line.
  - I will probably never do this because I will just manually skip outputs where lines touch.
