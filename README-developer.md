# A README for my own notes during development that I don't want to pubish to NPM

## How to deploy to NPM

Patch

```sh
npm version patch
```

Deploy

```sh
npm publish --access public
```

## To Do

- Port drawing.js from benwiz.github.io to a canvas-based implementation here using TypeScript
    - First, figure out how to move a dot across the screen because I'm unsure how a step/tick function will operate
