#  ofScrape

## What

Take a vertical or horizontal line of pixels and extend them past the edge of the image. Then vary the length of each pixel-line. The result looks like the image was scraped with a claw.

This actually one of the nicer looking things I have made.

## How

OpenFrameworks, C++

## To Do

- Rather than draw a polyline, draw an ellipse. Then take the average color between the two points in the ellipse
- Figure out how to have control over scrape length for each point
