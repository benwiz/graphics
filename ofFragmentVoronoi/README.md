#  fragmentVoronoi

## What

Draw a voronoi diagram around a set of points. Fill each cell with its average color. Move cells around. https://www.instagram.com/p/BpogVq8hAux/

## How

OpenFrameworks, C++

## To Do

- Better configs control... even if that is just moving some stuff to the header.
  - Maybe some keystrokes can control the config
- Mess with fill, texture, monochrome, gaps, etc. Should be able to do something really interesting using ofMesh.
- Consider introducing computer vision
- Don't fill with average color, select something that is more interesting
