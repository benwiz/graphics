## To Do

- Light border around each arc
  - Maybe do this by creating arcs that are slightly larger with no fill. These second arcs probably need to be stored in a second global arcs vector and drawn last while being nearly fully opaque.
- Read a simple YAML file for color palettes and select the palette by name. Do not automate the selection of the palette in the code, just write a good comment explaining which string must be changed to change the palette.
- Select 3 of my favorites and post to Instagram... maybe China colors, Indonesia colors, Korea colors?
