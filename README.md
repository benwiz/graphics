#  Mondrian

Randomly generate a Mondrian-like image.

Next project: recursiveMondrian

## To Do

- Background rectangle
- Get all points from line intersections
- Get rectangles from these points
- Color some in randomly as long as there is not already an underlying, background rectangle

### To Do Never

- Ensure lines are not too close to each other and merge into a single fat line.
  - I will probably never do this because I will just manually skip outputs where lines touch.
