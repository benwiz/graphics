## To Do

- Simple way of creating and selecting color palettes... maybe a YAML file
- Refine the spacing of circles and arcs
- Select 3 of my favorites and post to Instagram... maybe China colors, Indonesia colors, Korea colors?

- Spokes... I kind of liked the bug when there were spokes going to the center. Maybe this could be an evolution?
