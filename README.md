Create my first ClojureScript website and learn to use http://quil.info

## Squiggles

### Ten Print Remake

Copy of [this example](http://quil.info/sketches/local/c8a0c07b009b4f5d29e5a30e444ffc741fd99ccef22598ddc78bf0f5ca8571af) without looking at the examples code.

## Notes

Dev

```bash
lein figwheel
```

Build for prod

```bash
lein cljsbuild once optimized
```

## Ideas

- Flashing, twinkling shapes
- Constellations, if I can find a dataset

## To Do

- Now
  - Solar system
    - Draw accurate orbits
    - Accurate speeds
    - Figure out rotation... this is just to make it look good
    - Draw asteroid belt as a dotted or dashed circle. Will probably need to draw every point.

- Next
  - Create header and subtitle
  - Create nice looking format

- Later
  - Piece created by listening to music then display it with Spotify play button
  - Swimming squid
