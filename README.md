## To Do

- Consider having all dots move at slightly differing speeds
- More complex paths (probably allow overlapping)

## Other similar project ideas

- Some sort of path generation (random search/walk with dead ends?) then have the dots move all over the path bouncing off each other or merging into bigger dots
