# squiggle

Create my first ClojureScript website and learn to use http://quil.info

## Notes

Run web browser repl

```bash
clj --main cljs.main --compile squiggle.core --repl
```

## Ideas

- Swimming squid
- Separately, record soundwave from Spotify song or use matching MP3. Create animation and embed spotify player. Link the animation to the current timestamp of the embedded Spotify player.
