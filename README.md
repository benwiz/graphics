#  fragmentVoronoi

Draw a voronoi diagram around a set of points. Fill each cell with some color. Maybe the average color of all the pixels within the cell, maybe some other color that's a little more interesting, abstract, and vibrant. Maybe using a certain color palette and considering the randomly selected color of the neighbors to help select this cell's color.

## To Do

- Better configs control... even if that is just moving some stuff to the header.
  - Maybe some keystrokes can control the config
- Mess with fill, texture, monochrome, gaps, etc. Should be able to do something really interesting using ofMesh.
- Consider introducing computer vision
